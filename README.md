## Welcome to Encythe
Welcome to the place where I lose my mind!

I program or script a bunch of random stuff occasionally, sometimes sharing it with the world!

You can find additional details about me [here](https://encythe.xyz/), unless you're very vigilant about hyperlinks, at which point you can find me at https://encythe.xyz!

I mainly code in Python; however, I know a bunch of Luau as well.

## Things I'm working on
So, what I'm working on? Have at it:

\- [RobloxSplitter](https://github.com/Encythe/RobloxSplitter), a Python intermediate for one-way Roblox to LiveSplit communication, allowing for easy autosplitting setups as wished by developers.
\- [Encythe's Disk Analyzer](https://github.com/Encythe/Encythes-Disk-Analyzer), a full Python-based tool to get an overview on all mounted drives<br>
\- ["Roblox World Championship" Theme](https://github.com/Encythe/RWC-Theme), a stylus userstyle inspired by the general feel of <b>TETR.IO World Championship</b> `[worlds.tetr.io]`<br>
\- Everything Upgrade Tree's various services, like EUT Moderation for the [EUT Discord Server](discord.gg/eut) `[discord.gg/eut]` or The Satellite Project, which you may have known as the feature allowing <b>Cross-_game_</b> Global Chat for Roblox Games!
